# 2015-2019-Maryland-Households-Income-Study
## Introduction
Income is the basis of people's livelihood. This project investigates 2015-2019 income and distribution change of family and non-family households in Maryland, which can help understand people living quality and help government to adjust policies. To study this, 2015-2019 household income data is obtained from US Census Bureau website, and all the data is analyzed using Microsoft Excel. In this project, how the median and mean income, and income distribution have changed within past 5 years is studied. Change of income gap between families and non-family household is also analyzed.

These two graphs show the distribution of 2015-2019 families/non-family household income distribution in Maryland. As the graph shows, high income ranges above $75,000 are generally increasing, while low income range below $75,000 are decreasing within these five years, showing an generally increasing income for all households. However, the income difference between families and non-family household is also significant, for example, income of about 20% of families reached $200,000 in 2019, while less than 5% of non-family household did.

Income increase within past five years can be more clearly shown in these two graphs of mean and median household income. Both family and non-family household income increased. The significant income gap can also be shown. 
## Income gap increase

Mean and medium income gap is calculated as the difference between family income and non-family household income. This graph shows that income gap was also increasing in the past five years. 
## Conclusion
Two main results can be shown from the data. 
1. Families and non-family household income increases. 
2. Families income is significantly higher than non-family household, and the income gap is increasing in these five years.  

For further investigation, income data of more detailed household classification (e.g. married-couple families, single non-family households, student non-family household) can be collected and studied, to better known the weight of each group in changing overall income, and therefore come up with more targeted policies.
